\subsection{Twitter Data} % (fold)
\label{sub:twitter_data}
Twitter is a web platform where users can post short messages with up to 140 characters to broadcast things they want the world to know. These messages are called \textit{tweets} and the whole Twitter system became very famous in the last years. That's the reason why there's a high interest in performing sentiment analysis on twitter data. We are provided with a set of 8000 tweets where each tweet was annotaded by 7 persons. Each one scored the given tweet on a range from $-5$ to $5$ (where $-5$ indicates a very negativ, $0$ a neutral and $5$ a positive sentiment). The highest and lowest rate were ignored and the average of the remaining 5 scores is given for every 8000 tweets. This data is provided by \textit{SemEval-2015 Task 11}.
